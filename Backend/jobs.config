/*******************
 backend/jobs.config
 *******************

 'backend/jobs.config' is a Velo configuration file that lets you schedule code to run repeatedly at specified intervals. 

 Using scheduled jobs you can run backend code without any user interaction. For example, you could generate a weekly 
 report or run nightly data cleansing.

 You schedule code to run by creating a job.
 Each job defines which function to run and when to run it.
